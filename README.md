# Flashcards

A lightweight study tool that focuses on one thing: flashcards

Try it [here](https://flashcards-aberiggs-projects.vercel.app/)!

## Purpose

I built this so I didn't have to deal with clunky interfaces or annoying paywalls. It's not as nearly as feature rich as something like Quizlet, but it reduces friction so I can spend more time actually studying and less time searching for a tool that meets my needs.

## Features

- **Decks & cards** — Create decks, add and edit flashcards (front and back), delete decks and cards as needed.
- **Study mode** — Review cards with flip-to-reveal; rate each card as wrong, close, hard, or easy. Progress, last-studied times, and due counts are tracked.
- **Spaced repetition (SM-2)** — Confidence ratings drive the scheduling algorithm. Cards are automatically scheduled for future review.
- **Dashboard** — Memory stages (new, learning, reviewing, mastered) and a review forecast (cards due today, tomorrow, in 3 days, in 7 days).
- **Theme** — Light, dark, and system themes via the Options page.
- **Auth** — Sign in with GitHub; your data is scoped to your account and stays private.
